\section{Plan}
{We divided our task into three phases:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Build Structure. At this phase, we build and implement a GAN structure, including a generator and discriminator.


\item Train Model. At this phase, we use the code vector output by CodeBERT to train these two models. The generator and discriminator will eventually converge to a threshold.


\item Test Model. The main task of test phase is verify the accuracy of code vector output by GAN structure. 
We compare the code vector output by CodeBERT with the code vector output by GAN architecture through MRR comparison algorithm
\end{enumerate}
}
