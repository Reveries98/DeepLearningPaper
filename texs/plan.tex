\section{Plan}
{We divided our task into three phases:\\


1. Build Phase: In this phase, we build and implement a GAN structure, which include a generator and discriminator.


2. Train Phase: In this phase, we using code vectors output by CodeBERT to train them. The generator and discriminator will convergence in a threshold at last.


3. Test Phase: The main task of test phase is verify the accuracy of code vector output by GAN structure. We utilize the MRR comparison algorithm to test them, compared with the accuracy of code vector output by CodeBERT.
