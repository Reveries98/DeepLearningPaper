    Code search is a foundational task in software development, which studies semantic similarity between natural language queries and program code. Recent years have witnessed great progress made in code search. However, researchers tend to pre-train a code representation model in different program languages so that it can be used in code related downstream problems and then fine-tune it in code search with a specific program language. Our empirical study shows that there may be performance damage when fine-tuning code search in multiple program languages. We believe that it is caused by the entanglement between code identity information and code semantic information. Therefore, we proposed a search enhancement framework based on GAN, so as to reduce identity information provided by pretrained models. Our framework contains two networks: one is a generator, of which the intention is to generate code embedding vectors without identity information, and the other is a discriminator, aiming at recognizing whether there is identity information.
